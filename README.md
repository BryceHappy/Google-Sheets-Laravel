# Parse Google Sheets with Laravel

Parse google sheets with Laravel 5.7, the Google API Client Library, and League/Csv

This a simple method to access and parse google sheets in Laravel. This was created as a reference for my post at http://channingdefoe.com/using-laravel-with-google-drive-api-to-access-google-sheets/.

The code is located in the GoogleController and there is one route "/googleapi" defined in the web.php file.
